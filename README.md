# This data was combined as part of an in-class assignment, using the first two of the three available datasets.
# Before entering in R, I cleaned the data by:
  # Removing Hebrew or translating to English, as applicable.
  # Formatting the document so that the top row was composed of variable names 
  # Removing extraneous language added to explain the methodology
